# CPS Counter
I did this mini-project in order to test the new JetBrains IDE: [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/) (1.20.134 Public Preview). My feedback after this test? The IDE is, as expected, lightweight, while still incorporating the intelligence of intelliJ. But you can still see that it's a preview version, as it's not finished and not complete enough for my taste, so I might as well use VSCode. We'll see in the future when it's possible to use it in the cloud. <br><br>
I was also able to test [JetBrains AI](https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2023/06/ai-assistant-in-jetbrains-ides/), but I wasn't really satisfied. Having to open a dialog box isn't ideal, and I prefer [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), which completes everything all the time.<br><br>
In short, Fleet lets you write code with a bit of auto-completion, but you'll have to wait for a stable version and new features.
<br><br>
As for the project itself, it's a small, simple and lightweight counter of clicks per second.
